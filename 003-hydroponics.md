# Hydroponics iOS application tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn how to create iOS app that can present and interact with data retrieved from CityOS Hydroponics. 

Application will consist of two main features:
1. Live data view with graphs and current readings
2. Notifications view with notifications that are sent from Hydroponics

### 1. Requirements
* Xcode 7.3
* Carthage

### 2. App setup
Navigate to Xcode and create new Single View iOS application. Name it CityOS Hydroponics, set bundle identifier of your choice and set the application location.

Next up, weâ€™ll need to setup the dependencies that will be used in our application.

Create new file in the application root folder and name it Cartfile. In this file we will specify which dependencies we need for our application. Paste following into the file:

```
github "cityos/CoreCityOS"
github "danielgindi/Charts" ~> 2.2.4
github "realm/realm-cocoa"
```

* CoreCityOS - reading and presenting data from Hydroponics system to the application
* Charts - presenting data in charts
* Realm - caching for the notifications

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to fetch and build these frameworks from Github. 

Now we can link built frameworks with our application. Go to Xcode, click on the project and select **General** tab. After you scroll to the bottom you will see two sections *Embedded Binaries* and *Linked Frameworks and Libraries*.

Click on the little **+** button in the Embedded Binaries section. This will open up a dialog where you can select new frameworks that are embedded into the application. Click on **Add other** and navigate to *Carthage/Builds/iOS* folder inside application folder. In this folder you will find built frameworks that we specified in *Cartfile*. Select following frameworks and click Add:

```
* CoreCityOS.framework
* Realm.framework
* RealmSwift.framework
* Charts.framework
```

This will setup everything we need to start coding the application. 

### 3. CoreCityOS

To fetch data from Hydroponics and present it inside application  in usable form we will use **CoreCityOS** framework.

If you don't know what CoreCityOS is you can refer to these tutorials since that is not scope of this tutorial.

* [Introduction to CoreCityOS](http://cityos.io/tutorial/1914/CoreCityOS-Framework-Tutorial)
* [Create IOT framework with CoreCityOS](http://cityos.io/tutorial/1924/Create-framework-for-communication-with-IoT-devices)
* [Using CoreCityOS with Flowthings backend](http://cityos.io/tutorial/1915/Using-CoreCityOS-with-Flowthings-backend)

Our Hydroponics systems reads following data types:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Light
* Float
* Soil humidity

For any application that uses CoreCityOS framework to interact with IOT devices (in this case Hydroponics) we need to adopt several protocols. 

Create new file and name it **HydroponicsDataCollection.swift**. In this file we will create the data collection that is retrieved from the Hydroponics. At the top of the file add following line:

```swift
import CoreCityOS
```

Since some data types such as temperature and humidity are already present in CoreCityOS we'll need to create those which  are not.

```swift
extension DataType {
    public static let Float = DataType(dataIdentifier: "Float")
    public static let SoilHumidity = DataType(dataIdentifier: "Soil Humidity")
}
```

Now we have the necessary setup for our data collection.

```swift
public class HydroponicsDataCollection: LiveDataCollectionType, CustomStringConvertible {
    public var deviceData: DeviceData
    public var creationDate: NSDate
    public var allReadings: [LiveDataType] = []
    
    var temperature: LiveDataType {
        return LiveData(
            dataType: .Temperature,
            jsonKey: "temp",
            unitNotation: "C"
        )
    }
    
    var humidity: LiveDataType {
        return LiveData(
            dataType: .Humidity,
            jsonKey: "humid",
            unitNotation: "%"
        )
    }
    
    var light: LiveDataType {
        return LiveData(
            dataType: .NaturalLight,
            jsonKey: "Light",
            unitNotation: "lux"
        )
    }
    
    var float: LiveDataType {
        return LiveData(
            dataType: .Float,
            jsonKey: "FlowSw1",
            unitNotation: ""
        )
    }
    
    var soilHumidity: LiveDataType {
        return LiveData(
            dataType: .SoilHumidity,
            jsonKey: "Soil",
            unitNotation: "%"
        )
    }
    
    public init(readingID: String) {
        deviceData = DeviceData(deviceID: readingID)
        creationDate = NSDate()
        allReadings = [
            temperature,
            humidity,
            light,
            float,
            soilHumidity
        ]
    }
}
```

Class definition is pretty straight-forward. We adopted `LiveDataCollectionType` protocol from CoreCityOS and defined data types that will be used using `LiveDataType` protocols.

Next up we will define actual Hydroponics device using CoreCityOS `DeviceType` protocol. 

Create new file and name it **Hydroponics.swift**. Add following to the file:

```swift
import CoreCityOS

public class Hydroponics: DeviceType, CustomStringConvertible {
    public var creationDate: NSDate?
    public var dataCollection: LiveDataCollectionType
    public var location: DeviceLocation?
    public var deviceData: DeviceData
    
    public init(deviceID: String) {
        deviceData = DeviceData(deviceID: deviceID)
        dataCollection = HydroponicsDataCollection(readingID: deviceID)
        creationDate = NSDate()
    }
}
```

Again, setup is pretty simple. We created new class named Hydroponics and adopted `DeviceType` protocol and fulfilled necessary requirements such as data collection and device meta data.
